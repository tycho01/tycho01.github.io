## Apprehensive Excitement
Throughout 2023, I've had the pleasure of working as a peer tutor across two campuses in the UH system, focusing on certain areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of the courses I've tutored were Discrete Math I, Calculus I and II, as well as Program Structure in C / C++. I've worked with students of varying ages and mathematical backgrounds. When I initially set out on this new venture, I'll be the first to admit there was a twinge of reluctance on my part to take up tutoring a course like Program Structure as I was extremely rusty with any sort of code by that point and was not certain I'd be able to help as much as I really wanted to, despite remembering a bulk of the concepts. Nevertheless, I found myself experiencing a wave of excitement at the prospect of helping other students understand material I also grappled with in the not-so-distant past.

## Lessons in Communication
That sense of excitement and desire to help would quickly be put to the test as I navigated a multitude of situations, some involving students who did not share the same level of enthusiasm for learning the material as others did. Now, that's to be expected of course, as some people just wish to pass the class and that's completely fine. We've certainly all had moments like this ourselves, I know I have. What made it difficult was continuously having to keep their attention on the material, encouraging them when they got something right or could explain a concept or a process' steps back to me. This experience actually ended up being extremely valuable as it helped me develop a greater degree of patience, fluidity and adaptability when dealing with various people's personalities, even if they were worlds apart from my own or anything I was used to in the past.

## Dispelling The Biggest Myth of Teaching
Looking back on my experiences in the past year, I would say by and large the biggest myth about teaching that many people hold is this: whoever is teaching you is a point of authority and should never be questioned because they know absolutely everything about whatever it is they're teaching you. This is absolutely not true, the amount of times I and others have forgotten certain little details or entire concepts would probably make any unaware student blush in secondhand embarassment. We often need to sift through old notes and revise heavily on our own time in order to prepare for whatever topic may be thrown at us at any given moment. Even then, we may be completely blindsided by a student on a random Tuesday and we'd have to adapt anyway! That is to say, nothing ever truly works out the way we initially hope and knowing that but still trudging along and seeing what happens is what makes life interesting.
