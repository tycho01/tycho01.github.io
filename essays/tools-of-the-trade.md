## Issue Driven Project Management: The Key To Success
Imagine you're on a trip, driving through unfamiliar territory. You have no cellphone on you, not even a map yet you still persist. You're driving along, trying to find your way, but you're not quite where you're going. You know where you want to end up, but not anywhere in between. This is exactly what it feels like to work on a project without Issue Driven Project Management. See, IDPM is a style of Project Management which focuses on beginning with a wider vision for some project, then slowly evolving towards it with the help of issues. These are essentially smaller tasks that act as sign-posts, guiding you towards your eventual final destination.

## Applications
The beauty of this style of project management lies in its versatility. Although it seems to commonly be used for software projects, this is hardly the only area of application available. This is something that I plan to apply to my own life, perhaps at work as a sort of ticketing system of my own. The sense of accomplishment from ticking off multiple smaller tasks until eventually the entire log is done or at least extremely minimized is something I've come to find extremely satisfying. Outside of work, this could absolutely apply to personal goals as well. Be they fitness milestones, financial milestones, or anything in-between.

## Coding Standards: Why I Care and You Should Too
Coding standards, that set of rules that defines *how* one should write code. It's such a simple concept, but one I've come to appreciate more and more as I draw towards the end of my software engineering course. Hearing my peers snarl at the very idea of having a set of standards that everyone agrees (or is made to agree) upon is an incredibly confusing experience. I cannot count on two hands alone the number of times I've found myself perplexed at the usage of a storage duration and variable name that completely goes against the original intent and for no discernible reason. While this may seem like a relatively minor issue, it's one that opens up a much bigger issue down the line. For others who have to maintain that code at a later date, it will be difficult to know what it's supposed to be doing or handling if it's improperly named as well as handle any unexpected behavior that arises from an odd storage declaration. Maybe it'll still exist and be accessible at some point you never wanted it to during the program's execution or maybe it'll be accessible by another part of the program that it really shouldn't be! Enforcing this just by speaking with teammates is not always possible though, so the implementation of automatically run formatters and linters to *loudly* complain about non-compliance is a godsend as I've come to learn through various software projects. Personally, I plan on using these in every project I work on in the future, even if they're personal projects too.
